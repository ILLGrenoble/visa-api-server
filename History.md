 * Map guacamole long-name keyboard layouts to webx shortened ones.
 * Fix logging error on slow execution of VDI messages
 * Add a redis health monitor (optional... beta testing). Check pub-sub connection to redis every 10s. If subscriber fails then re-create the subscription.
 * Use virtual thread to publish redis messages: potential timeouts (from thread locks?).
 * Remove all explicit threading from the desktop message handling: run on the same websocket thread (blocking).
 * Add DesktopExecutorService to create a thread pool (system threads) for the creation/deletion of VDI sessions. Use a completable future to block to websocket request until the actions have completed.

 * Fix bug on InstanceSessionMember.active not being set to false when concurrent updates of ISMs occur (one to update the interactionAt and another to deactivate).

 * Update to relay 1.2.0 (waits for webx connection message).
 * Improve logging of event channel disconnection

3.2.4 22/04/2025
